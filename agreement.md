## Conflict Plan

1. In a situation where a conflict arises, we have agreed to a discussion for 15 minutes.   
2. If the conflict is not resolved in this amount of time, we have agreed that we will vote on the issue.
3. A vote will be taken on a scale of 1-4, 1 being strongly towards decision A, and 4 being strongly for decision B.  
4. After averaging the votes, we will go the way of the voted decision.  
5. In the event of a tie, we decided to "rock, paper, scissors".

## Communication Plan

* We agreed that normal **"in-office"**  hours will be from **9:00 - 5:30**.
* We agreed that two daily gatherings will occur, **the first at 9:15am**, and the **second after lunch at 1:15**.  This will allow us to arrive around 9:00, get set-up, and prepare to address any situations.
* At each gathering, we will discuss progress, blocking issues, and plan of attack.
* We will make sure that everyone has a voice, by making sure we take turns in a circular manner.
* We also have agreed that we will communicate in Slack, and attempt to be semi-active while away (but also understand the we to have to have a work-life balance).
