This game is modeled after Oregon Trail, but has a more modern financial slant to it. The player is presented with a combination of questions and random events. The players responses, in conjunction with the random events, will alter their financial status accordingly.

Many people in today's consumer culture do not consider their decisions carefully, especially when it comes to the financial consequences. This game attempts to highlight the financial results of the choices we make over a lifetime.
