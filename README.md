## Description
This game is modeled after the game of Life, but has a more modern financial slant to it. The player is presented with a combination of questions and random events. The player's responses, in conjunction with the random events, will alter their status accordingly.

Many people in today's consumer culture do not consider their decisions carefully, especially when it comes to the financial consequences. This game attempts to highlight the financial results of the choices we make over a lifetime, as well as the importance of expecting the unexpected to occur from time to time.
